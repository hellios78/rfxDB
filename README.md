NoSQL Database for Reactive Fast Data Processing

* Query data RQL (Reactive Query Language)
* Processing fast data as real-time view, there are 3 kind of data would be stored queried:
  + behavioral data (game, interests, touch, impressions, click, view,...)
  + context data (location, time, referrer, lead , session, ...)
  + entity data (user, games, revenue, marketing compaign, products, Buy in-app items, ...)
* Data pipeline processing for "fast data"
* Design for lightweight Lambda Architecture
